Inspired by [Brad Feld's birthday posts](https://feld.com/archives/2020/12/bfeld-v55-0.html), I thought I would make my own. 

### Work
In February of 2020, I took a risk and decided to leave DaVita in the hopes of gaining more exposure to traditional business and product. While 2020 has been a hell of a year to navigate a new role, the gamble was more than worth it. Over the last couple of months, I have greatly increased my programming capabilities and have built out several executive-level dashboards. Building and communicating analytics to executives and product managers have been a really rewarding and great experience. 
I am not entirely sure what is next in my career, but I am happy about the decisions I have made recently. I am now pondering what my next professional steps will be. I am considering a much more stereotypical data science role, expanding on my technical capabilities or the management route. 
### Play
COVID has been great for outdoor activities, I have ridden my bike the most out of any single year (I will end this year cycling, running, walking, and hiking somewhere around 3,500 miles), even more so than when I was racing in college. I taught myself fly fishing and archery. I also camped more in 2020 than any other year living in Colorado. I plan on increasing these activities in 2021, hopefully culminating with an archery elk hunt in the fall of 2021.
### COVID 
COVID in many ways has made 2020 a frustrating year, I am an extremely extroverted person and so that has been tough. That being said I have gotten into cooking at home which has been a lot of fun, especially meats. 
### Abby
My partner Abby continues to a core aspect of my life. The joy, growth, and fulfillment that our partnership brings continue to amaze me. It is probably the smartest move I can continue to make in terms of money, time, and energy.
### Friendships & Networking 
This is an aspect of my life that I want to take much more seriously in a post COVID world. Life is just too short not to. 
### Time
One thing that COVID and probably losing three grandparents in the last 18 months has taught me is how much more deliberate I need to be with my time, it's such a precious asset that I probably haven't valued enough. For some reason 27 seems like a big birthday to me, much more so in the past. 27 in some weird way always felt to symbolize true adulthood. In some ways, I feel both adequately and ill-prepared at the exact same time. Either way, I am excited to lean into that feeling.
