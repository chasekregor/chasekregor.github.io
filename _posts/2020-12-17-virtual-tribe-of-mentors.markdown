Truth be told, I haven't always been the best at acquiring mentors or even sustaining friendships over long periods for that matter. Life can simply happen; you can move, your interests change, etc.

Despite this, I know that mentorship and friendships are important for a plethora of reasons. Some of the most insightful friendships I've had have come from people 5-15 years older than myself.
