Inspired by [Brad Feldâ€™s birthday posts](https://feld.com/archives/2020/12/bfeld-v55-0.html), and [last year's post](https://chasekregor.com/2020/12/21/chase-kregor-v27/), I thought I would make my own.

### Work

27 was a really weird year career-wise. I navigated some tough career decisions all during COVID. 

I am now working at a value-based healthcare startup. My role is the perfect mixture of business and technical skills right now. I can truly say I am at my dream job. I wish I would have joined a startup sooner. I love that it's growing my technical skills and teaching me how to analyze and communicate different healthcare deal structures. Looking forward to potentially managing people in the future. 

### Play

Some highlights from 2021:
- Archery elk hunt in the fall in which I came within 20 yards of two bull elk and even closer to a bear, unfortunately. Not getting one of those elk is going to bother me all year. 
- Spent the 4th of July camping at Twin Lakes with Abby. A memory I will never forget
- I ran at least 1 mile a day for 126 days in a row. 
- The first year I have ever legitimately gotten into running.
- Went snowshoeing for the first time with Abby in Breckenridge
- Went spring Turkey hunting and missed a turkey with my bow. 
- I grew ~50 tomatoes this Spring! Gardening is AWESOME!
- Abby and I threw a Toure de France party which was a blast
- Hiked a 14er with Abby (her first 14er!)
- Went to Yosemite, it genuinely lives up to the hype. 
- Did an overnight elk scouting trip with Abby. I am so lucky to have a partner that supports my hobbies. 
- Got more into hiking this year. 

### Abby

I proposed to Abby and she said yes. It is the proudest accomplishment of my life. Now planning a wedding. 

### Time

Lost my last grandparent this year. You have a lot less time than you realize. Try to make today and every day after it count. 

### Goals
- Get married in 2022.
- To consistently and simultaneously work out AND work at my job very hard. In the past, I have done one of these things very well sacrificing performance on the other. This year I really want to focus on optimizing the two of these areas of my life.  
- Learn more about personal finance and what it means for me
- Explore the topic of leadership, reading about great leaders throughout history.
