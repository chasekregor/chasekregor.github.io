I"M<p>Inspired by <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2020/12/bfeld-v55-0.html">Brad Feld’s birthday posts</a>, and <a href="https://chasekregor.com/2020/12/21/chase-kregor-v27/">last year’s post</a> I thought I would make my own.</p>

<p>27 was a really weird year career wise. I navigated some tough career decisions all during COVID.</p>

<p>I am now working at a value-based healthcare startup. My role is the perfect mixture of business and technical skills right now. I can truly say I am at my dream job. I wish I would have joined a startup sooner. I love that it’s growing my technical skills and teaching me how to analyze and communicate different healthcare deal structures. Looking forward to potentially managing people in the future.</p>

<p>Some highlights from 2021:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Archery elk hunt in the fall in which I came within 20 yards of two bull elk and even closer to a bear, unfortunately. Not getting one of those elk is going to bother me all year.</li>
  <li>Spent the 4th of July camping at Twin Lakes with Abby. A memory I will never forget</li>
  <li>I ran at least 1 mile a day for 126 days in a row.</li>
  <li>The first year I have ever legitimately gotten into running.</li>
  <li>Went snowshoeing for the first time with Abby in Breckenridge</li>
  <li>Went spring Turkey hunting and missed a turkey with my bow.</li>
  <li>I grew ~50 tomatoes this Spring! Gardening is AWESOME!</li>
  <li>Abby and I threw a Toure de France party which was a blast</li>
  <li>Hiked a 14er with Abby (her first 14er!)</li>
  <li>Went to Yosemite, it genuinely lives up to the hype.</li>
  <li>Did an overnight elk scouting trip with Abby. I am so lucky to have a partner that supports my hobbies.</li>
  <li>Got more into hiking this year.</li>
</ul>

<p>I proposed to Abby and she said yes. It is the proudest accomplishment of my life. Now planning a wedding.</p>

<p>Lost my last grandparent this year. You have a lot less time than you realize. Try to make today and every day after it count.</p>
