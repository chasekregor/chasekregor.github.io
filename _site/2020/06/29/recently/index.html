  <h2 id="on-2020">On 2020</h2>

<p>It is halfway through the year and now might be a good time for some reflection and an update.</p>

<p>2020 has in many ways been an <em>interesting</em> year. There is a global pandemic happening, a massive movement and discussion regarding race and police brutality in America, all amidst economic turmoil and a rapidly approaching a presidential election.</p>

<p>This is a difficult moment in time for people.</p>

<p>Something that has helped me during this time has been to ask myself “what is and isn’t within my control?” Asking myself this question daily has enabled me to live my life with some forward momentum during a time of uncertainty, understanding that there are certain aspects of my personal and professional life that I simply don’t have any control over.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I recently finished the book <em>Digital Minimalism</em> by Cal Newport and can’t recommend it enough. I am about to embark on his 30-day digital declutter. More to come about that at a later time. This year I have also read <em>Why We Sleep</em> by Mathew Walker, <em>Everything Is F</em>cked* by Mark Manson, and <em>Extreme Ownership</em> by Jacko Willink.</p>

<h2 id="thinking">Thinking</h2>
<p>A recurring topic that I have been pondering has been how to maximize my time outside of work for more learning and or leisure. This idea lead me to a couple of new things. One is my 30-day digital declutter, two reading <em>Ultralearning</em> by Scott H. Young, and three attempting to teach myself how to fly fish. Turns out, fly fishing is much harder than I originally anticipated, it requires a lot of patience, something I could work on.</p>

<p>Here is a photo of me fly fishing at Chatfield State Park this past weekend while car camping with friends.</p>

<h2 id="cycling">Cycling</h2>
<p>I am track to make 2020 my biggest year in terms of mileage. The one positive out of the pandemic has been the amount of cycling Abby and I have done together. I also just completed a 10-week racing league on <a href="www.zwift.com">zwift</a> in which I came 4th in the league. I just missed the podium but learned a ton about zwift racing and want to do it more competitively in the future.</p>

<p>Here is a photo of me cycling a couple of weeks ago in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-i-am-currently-pondering">Quotes I am Currently Pondering</h2>
<p>“I will keep constant watch over myself and—most usefully—will put each day up for review. For this is what makes us evil—that none of us looks back upon our own lives. We reflect upon only that which we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future descend from the past.” — Seneca</p>
